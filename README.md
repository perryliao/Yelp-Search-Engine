# Yelp Search Engine
_We wanted to use the Prolog knowledge we have learned in class and extrapolate it something applicable to daily life._


## To Run the Program
1. `swipl`
2. `[main].`
3. If this is your first time running the program, run `init().`
4. To write a query, run `askUser().`

---

# Exmaple Queries
"Find the best mexican restaurant nearby"

"Recommend the cheapest korean food in kyoto"

# Something Extra!
"I'm feeling lucky"

The program saves all your recorded queries, and uses them to find something catered to you! Enter this to the program to get something back, just for you!
Should the user wish to reset their data, run `clear_cache().` and that will reset everything the program knows about the current user.
